# Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm

## Overview
Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm is an incremental algorithm used for drawing lines on a discrete grid. It efficiently determines the coordinates of points that approximate a line segment between two given points. One of the notable features of the algorithm is its ability to use only integer arithmetic, making it computationally efficient.

This repository contains a C++ implementation of Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm for two cases: when the slope (m) is 0 < m < 1 and when m > 1. The algorithm efficiently draws a line on a grid using only integer arithmetic.

## Files
- `bresenham_line.cpp`: The C++ code implements the algorithm and generates a grid with '*' characters to represent the drawn line.
- `README.md`: This file, provides an overview of the algorithm and the generated output.

## Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
### Decision Parameter
At the heart of Bresenham's algorithm is the decision parameter, a value that helps determine which pixel to choose next along the line. The decision parameter is crucial for efficiently selecting points on the line.

### Case 1: 0 < m < 1
When the slope `m` of the line is between 0 and 1, the algorithm increments the x-coordinate by 1 for each step and adjusts the y-coordinate based on the decision parameter.

#### Decision Parameter Update
- If the decision parameter is greater than or equal to 0, the y-coordinate is incremented by 1, and the decision parameter is adjusted.
- If the decision parameter is less than 0, only the decision parameter is adjusted.

### Case 2: m > 1
When the slope `m` is greater than 1, the algorithm increments the y-coordinate by 1 for each step and adjusts the x-coordinate based on the decision parameter.

#### Decision Parameter Update
- If the decision parameter is greater than or equal to 0, the x-coordinate is incremented by 1, and the decision parameter is adjusted.
- If the decision parameter is less than 0, only the decision parameter is adjusted.

## Key Steps of the Algorithm
1. Calculate the differences in x and y coordinates: `dx = x2 - x1` and `dy = y2 - y1`.
2. Determine the signs of increments: `signX = (dx > 0) ? 1 : -1` and `signY = (dy > 0) ? 1 : -1`.
3. Use absolute values for increments: `dx = abs(dx)` and `dy = abs(dy)`.
4. Initialize the decision parameter: `decision = 2 * dy - dx`.
5. Iterate through the steps of the algorithm:
   - Update coordinates and decision parameters based on the selected case.
   - Mark the corresponding point on the grid.
## Output
The generated output consists of a 10x10 grid for each test case, with the line represented by '*' characters. The coordinates of the points on the line are also outputted, providing a clear representation of the drawn line.

## Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm is an incremental algorithm that determines the points of an approximate line between two given points. It is particularly useful for drawing lines on a grid system and is known for its efficiency in using only integer arithmetic.

The algorithm handles two cases:
1. When 0 < m < 1: The algorithm increments the x-coordinate by 1 for each step and adjusts the y-coordinate based on the decision parameter.
2. When m > 1: The algorithm increments the y-coordinate by 1 for each step and adjusts the x-coordinate based on the decision parameter.

## Output
The generated output consists of a 10x10 grid for each test case, with the line represented by '*' characters. The coordinates of the points on the line are also outputted, providing a clear representation of the drawn line.
